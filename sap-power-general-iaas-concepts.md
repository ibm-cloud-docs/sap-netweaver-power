# SAP NetWeaver on Power Systems Virtual Servers IaaS Overview
{: #sap-netweaver-on-ibm-cloud-iaas-overview}

IBM and SAP have been teaming, partnering, and collaborating in areas that include hardware, software, cloud, services, and financing for close to 50 years. The first collaboration was in the early 1970s and has continued to grow with hundreds of SAP clients that use {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} as their infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solution. {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} has continued to optimize its cloud infrastructure products to include support for SAP NetWeaver solutions.
