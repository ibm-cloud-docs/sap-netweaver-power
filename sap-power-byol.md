# Bring your own SAP product license
{: #bring-your-own-sap-product-license}

In the {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSysShort}} environment, you can bring your own license (BYOL) for your SAP products; you need to apply the corresponding license for your SAP products after installation. If you are new to SAP, start exploring under [SAP All Products](https://www.sap.com/products.html){: external}. You can also contact SAP Sales or SAP Support for details on how to obtain the required licenses.

If you purchased your SAP and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Db2 for Linux&reg;, UNIX, and Windows (LUW) licenses as part of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM)/application specific licensing (ASL) agreement, you can download and apply license files from the [SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html){: external}; click **Download Software**. For more information, see [SAP Note 816773](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/816773){: external} Installing an SAP OEM license. However, if you purchased {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Db2 LUW from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} or an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Business Partner, you must use the license files that are provided by your vendor instead.
